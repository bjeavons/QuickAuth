## QuickAuth: Safe and quick authentication for mobile and desktop browsers


QuickAuth is a method for webapp authenticaton using Javascript bookmarklets for posting one-time tokens based on a shared secret key.

QuickAuth allows for quick and easy login to a site by eliminating the need to remember and type a potentially difficult password. This benefit is fully realized on mobile devices where the keyboard controls often make strong passwords difficult to fully enter.
